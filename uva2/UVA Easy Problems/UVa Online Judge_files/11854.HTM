<h2>Problem A: Egypt</h2>

A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a
triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 had a
right angle as its largest angle.  
You must
determine if other triangles have a similar
property.

<h2>The Input</h2>

Input represents several test cases, followed
by a line containing 0 0 0.
Each test case has three positive
integers, less than 30,000,
denoting the lengths of the sides of
a triangle.

<h2>The Output</h2>

For each test case, a line containing "right" if
the triangle is a right triangle, and a line containing
"wrong" if the triangle is not a right triangle.

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>6 8 10
25 52 60
5 12 13
0 0 0
</pre>
<h2>Output for Sample Input</h2>
<pre>right
wrong
